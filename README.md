# CSS385-A-FinalProject

##  Elevator Pitch
This is a fast-paced 2D space survival shooter. You pilot a small ship through an asteroid field, collecting valuable scrap to upgrade your ship. Every piece of scrap adds weight, making your ship slower and harder to control. Will you risk everything for one more haul, or escape before you’re crushed by debris?

##  Game Synopsis, Objective, and Mechanics

### Synopsis
Set in the wreckage of a destroyed mining colony, you play as a lone scavenger searching for valuable materials drifting through deep space. Time and mobility are your greatest enemies as the asteroid field grows more chaotic the longer you stay.

### Objective
Survive as long as possible while collecting scrap to upgrade your ship and reach the highest salvage score before escaping safely.

### Core Mechanics
- **Movement:** Use thrusters for 360° navigation (Keyborad: W, A, S, D).
- **Shoot:** Use the weapon to destroy the asteroids.
- **Collection:** Gather scrap using a magnetic beam.
- **Risk System:** Cargo weight slows the ship, increasing danger.
- **Upgrades:** Improve engines, shields, and cargo hold between runs.
- **Randomized Asteroids:** Each session feels unique and replayable.
